  "about_me_description": "Hello, I'm Tiago Cruz, a 21-year-old guy from Vila Real. I have a degree in Communication and Multimedia from UTAD, and throughout my academic journey, I discovered my passion for web development.\n\nI have always been a very active person and passionate about sports, especially futsal. I loved spending my time playing, whether in training, with friends, or in more informal games. However, over time, I realized that my interest in technology and creativity was growing more and more. So, I decided to explore the world of programming, a field that excited me and is now a part of my life.\n\nMy approach to development and creativity is highly influenced by my life experiences, which involve moments with friends, a lot of energy, and a love for gaming and music.\n\nI'm always motivated to grow, both professionally and personally, and I strive every day to evolve in all aspects of my life, whether in technology, sports, or personal relationships.",
  "education_description": "Bachelor's Degree in Communication and Multimedia - UTAD\n\nDuring my degree, I had the opportunity to explore various areas of communication, including graphic design, photography, audiovisual work, and web development. I was constantly challenged to think creatively and find innovative solutions to complex problems.\n\nI became particularly passionate about web programming, which led me to deepen my knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. Throughout the journey, I realized the importance of visual communication and had the chance to work on several design projects, always with a focus on user experience.\n\nThe education I received at UTAD was not limited to theoretical foundations. The university also provided valuable practical experiences, such as various academic projects and an internship, which were crucial for my professional growth and preparation for the job market.",
  "experience_description": "During my curricular internship at Purple Profile, I had the opportunity to dive deeper into Symfony, a framework that challenged me to think more technically. It was in this environment that I developed a REST API to support two websites, both built with React and Tailwind CSS. One of these websites was an admin control panel, and the other was the main site. This project was a turning point for me, as I was able to apply not only my back-end skills but also enhance my front-end skills, gaining a better understanding of how technologies integrate and work together.\n\nDuring my academic studies, I had the chance to work on several projects, both individually and in teams. One of the most impactful projects was the development of my personal portfolio, built with React. In this project, I was able to showcase what I had learned so far and explore new ways to improve user experience while refining my front-end skills.\n\nThroughout my studies, I also worked on three academic projects that gave me a very practical insight into the development process. One of these projects was developed in PHP, and the other two were built with Laravel and Blade. Each of these projects helped me deepen my knowledge of different technologies and frameworks, and gave me the opportunity to better understand how to build complete web applications, from design to implementation.\n\nAlthough I am just starting my career, I am always in search of new challenges. I want to continue growing, learning, and expanding my skills, so I can contribute more and more to innovative and quality solutions.",
